            This admin-only endpoint anonymizes user PII while preserving business data
            integrity and maintaining referential relationships for conversations and

            This operation:
            - Removes personally identifiable information (PII)
            - Retains email for legal compliance purposes
            - Prevents future login by clearing credentials
            - Maintains foreign key relationships (conversations, logs)
            - Logs the deletion event with legal basis for audit compliance

            Unlike hard deletion, this approach:
            - Complies with GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure)
            - Preserves business analytics data
            - Eliminates foreign key constraint violations
            - Maintains audit trails for legal requirements
