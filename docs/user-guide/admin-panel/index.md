# Admin Panel

The boilerplate ships a built-in admin panel powered by [SQLAdmin](https://github.com/smithyhq/sqladmin). It gives you a web interface for browsing and editing the database without writing custom CRUD endpoints.

!!! tip "Building a full SaaS?"
    The admin panel is part of the free foundation. **[FastroAI](https://fastro.ai)** bundles it with Stripe payments, entitlements, transactional email, a frontend, and AI agents - all wired together and production-ready. [Ship your SaaS faster →](https://fastro.ai)

## Accessing the Admin Panel

The admin panel is mounted at `/admin`. It's enabled by default — toggle it with:

```env
ADMIN_ENABLED=true   # set to false to disable entirely
```

Authentication is **separate from your app's session auth**. Admin login uses simple username/password credentials read from environment variables:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
SECRET_KEY=<used for admin session encryption>
```

Visit <http://localhost:8000/admin>, enter those credentials, and you're in.

!!! warning "Login is disabled until credentials are configured"
    `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` default to empty. With either unset, **every admin login attempt fails** — an empty form submission does not authenticate. Set both before the panel is usable.

- **[Adding Models](adding-models.md)** - Register your own models with the admin interface
- **[User Management](user-management.md)** - Admin authentication and security

## What's Included

The boilerplate registers one model view out of the box (in `src/interfaces/admin/views/`):

| View | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Users** | `views/users.py` | Create / edit / delete users; password hashing applied automatically; soft-delete-aware |

It is categorized under "Users & Access" and provides search, sort, filter, and CSV export.

If you want admin views for other models, follow the [Adding Models](adding-models.md) guide.

## Common Operations

### Creating a User

Navigate to **Users → Create**. Fill the form. The `Password` field accepts plaintext — `UserAdmin.on_model_change` runs `get_password_hash()` before saving so the database only ever sees the hash.

### Editing a User

Click any user row → **Edit**. You can toggle `is_superuser`, update OAuth fields, etc. The hashed password field is shown but you only need to fill it if you want to reset the password.

## How Authentication Works

The admin panel uses session-based auth via `SessionMiddleware` (Starlette), separate from the API's session system. When you submit the login form:

1. `AdminAuth.login` validates the credentials against `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
2. On success, sets `request.session["admin_authenticated"] = True`
3. Subsequent requests check that flag

This is intentionally simpler than the main app's session system — the admin panel is for a small number of trusted operators, not end users. The session is encrypted with `SECRET_KEY`.

## How It's Wired

The admin app is created in `src/interfaces/admin/initialize.py` and mounted in `src/interfaces/main.py` at startup:

```python
# interfaces/admin/initialize.py
from sqladmin import Admin

from ...infrastructure.config.settings import get_settings
from ...infrastructure.database.session import get_engine
from .auth import AdminAuth
from .views import register_admin_views


def create_admin_interface(app) -> Admin | None:
    settings = get_settings()
    if not settings.ADMIN_ENABLED:
        return None

    admin = Admin(
        app=app,
        engine=get_engine(),
        authentication_backend=AdminAuth(secret_key=settings.SECRET_KEY),
        title="Admin",
    )
    register_admin_views(admin)
    return admin
```

Calling `create_admin_interface(app)` from `main.py` mounts everything at `/admin`. If `ADMIN_ENABLED=false`, the function returns `None` and nothing is mounted.

## Disabling in Production

If you don't want the admin panel reachable in production, set:

```env
ADMIN_ENABLED=false
```

Or keep it enabled but restrict network access at the load balancer / proxy level (e.g. only allow `/admin` from your VPN's CIDR).
